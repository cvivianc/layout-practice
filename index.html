            <h1>CSS Layout</h1>
            <p>CSS page layout techniques allow us to take elements contained in a web page and control where they’re
                positioned relative to the following factors: their default position in normal layout flow, the other
                elements around them, their parent container, and the main viewport/window.</p>
            <p>Each technique has its uses, advantages, and disadvantages. No technique is designed to be used in
                isolation. By understanding what each layout method is designed for you’ll be in a good position to
                understand which method is most appropriate for each task.</p>

            <h2>CSS Box Model</h2>
            <p>There are lots of great resources online to help you learn the CSS Box Model: <a
                    href=“https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model”
                    target=“_blank”>CSS Box Model</a>. To quote the content:</p>
            <blockquote><strong>“Everything in CSS has a box around it,</strong> and understanding these boxes is key to
                being able to create layouts with CSS, or to align items with other items.“</blockquote>
            <p>As quoted, every HTML element is indeed considered as a rectangular box by the browser.</p>
            <img src="img/note2.jpg" alt=“photo of wireframe” class="small-img">
            <p>The CSS Box Model consists of four properties: content, padding, border, and margin. Which can be seen in
                the illustration above.</p>
            <p class="clear"> It’s pretty easy to understand the Content portion of the box model. The content is whatever your HTML
                consists of. It could be a paragraph full of text, or a bulleted list, or an image.</p>
            <p>Beginning web designers and developers may have some trouble keeping the other parts of the box model
                straight, so it is important to examine them one by one.</p>

            <h2>Padding</h2>
            <p>Padding immediately surrounds the content area. Padding is often used to give the content area some
                breathing room by separating the content from the surrounding border area.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Border</h2>
            <p>The border area of the box is the outermost part of the box. You can think of it as giving the
                rectangular box an outline. Borders tend to be hidden on most CSS elements by default, but once visible
                different styles like color and thickness can be applied to them.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Margin</h2>
            <p>The margin area exists outside of the box. Margin is the space around an element that separates it from
                other elements.</p>
            <p>It’s important to remember that padding and border affect the size of a CSS box, but margin doesn’t.</p>
